		<h3>Help us improve ST-JS</h3>
		<p>You can help us improve ST-JS in many different ways:</p>



		<h4>Improve the various ST-JS modules</h4>
		<p>Get the source code of ST-JS from the github repository at:
			<a href="http://github.com/st-js/st-js">https://github.com/st-js/st-js</a>. Feel free to fork that
			repository, make your own changes and submit pull requests. If you want to, you can also request
			direct push access by asking Alexandru Craciun.</p>




		<h4>Improve the documentation and/or the website:</h4>
		<p>Our website and documentation is served through Github pages, you can therefore contribute to the
			website (with a better design, organization, etc...) and the documentation it contains (various
			bridges, general information, tutorial etc...) simply by cloning the Github repository of the website
			at <a href="http://github.com/st-js/st-js.github.io">https://github.com/st-js/st-js.github.io</a>.
			Again, feel free to fork that repository, make your own changes and submit pull requests. If you
			want to, you can also request direct push access by asking Alexandru Craciun.</p>



		<h4>Write your own JavaScript library bridge:</h4>
